# 🛍️ eShoppers — JSP/Servlet-based E-Commerce Web Application

A Java-based e-commerce web application designed to simulate a real online shopping system with core features such as product browsing, cart management, and order placement.

This project demonstrates classic Java web development using Servlets and JSP, along with JDBC for database integration and implementation of basic shopping cart functionality.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- Java (Servlets & JSP)  
- JDBC for database operations  
- MySQL (or your choice of RDBMS)  
- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap for frontend  
- Bootstrap / Responsive UI  
- GitHub for source control

## 🎯 Key Features

✔ Product listing  
✔ Product search & details  
✔ Shopping cart add/remove logic  
✔ User interaction (guest/registered)  
✔ Order placement simulation  
✔ Cart total calculation  
✔ Session management for cart

## 📡 User Flow

1. User visits the home page  
2. Views the list of products  
3. Adds products to cart  
4. Updates quantities or removes from cart  
5. Proceeds to checkout  
6. Order summary (no real payment integration)

## 📦 How to Run Locally

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lhossainduet094026/eshoppers.git
cd eshoppers

2️⃣ Import Project into Java IDE
Open the project in Eclipse / IntelliJ as a Maven or Dynamic Web Project.

3️⃣ Setup Database
Create a MySQL database (e.g., eshoppers):

CREATE DATABASE eshoppers;
Update database config in the code (likely in DBUtil or a properties file).

4️⃣ Deploy on Local Server
Deploy the project to a web server like Apache Tomcat:

Run on http://localhost:8080/eshoppers

Ensure your JDBC driver is in the classpath

📌 Main Web Pages (Examples)
Page	Description
/products.jsp	Display all products
/cart.jsp	Shopping cart page
/checkout.jsp	Order summary
/productDetails.jsp	Product detail page

(Adjust names based on your actual JSP filenames)

🧠 Concepts Demonstrated
MVC architecture

JDBC database connectivity

Session tracking for shopping cart

Dynamic page rendering with JSP

HTML + Bootstrap UI

Basic web routing with Servlets

📈 Future Improvements
You could extend this project by:

Adding user authentication (login/register)

Real payment gateway integration

Order history tracking

Admin panel for product management

Search filters & pagination

REST API version for frontend frameworks

🧾 Notes for Recruiters
This project is a hands‑on demonstration of Java web fundamentals and e‑commerce logic using traditional Java server tech. It’s not just sample code — it simulates real application behaviour and user flows.
